I am passionate about coding! I enjoy being creative and technical at the same time and building products that solve real world problems.

I have a BSc from Imperial College and an MSc from Warwick University. I have a professional background in the food production industry. I have acquired qualifications and developed skills in programming and I am applying them in Software Development. I have a strong willingness and desire to learn new tools, techniques and technologies in order to broaden my skillset and make me a better developer.

## Skills

#### Analysis & Reporting
I can produce accurate and informative documentation using MS Office Programs especially to compare and contrast strategies, devise future business models and to plan mitigation. I am proficient in MS Excel. My projects and responsibilities at LandAfrique Agriculture and SIAT Group culminated in accurate written reports detailing financial, market, and competition information with an advanced level of attention to detail.

#### Communication & Management
My experience has honed my interpersonal skills. I have worked with a variety of business backgrounds and I am adaptive and personable. I can compromise, negotiate and adapt either in teams or independently. I can work effectively independently and I have a proactive and preemptive work ethic geared towards problem solving and risk mitigation. At SIAT Group I learned how to communicate in effective and efficient ways in French and English and to implement feedback observations while managing rubber tapping training. I have become proficient at team management and organisation.

#### Project Management
I have experience in analysing and logically developing and deploying improved strategies as necessary. I can suggest and justify improvements and streamlining possibilities for increasing logistical, and business efficiency, and solve problems by comparing and contrasting possible solutions. At SIAT Group I contributed to improvements in rubber production efficiency by 10% through a first-in-first-out storage policy which I designed and implemented.

#### Research
I can effectively extract and process information from academic sources, company annual reports, news articles, NGO and parastatal organisation publications for the production of market information and scrutinisation of viable opportunities. At LandAfrique Agriculture I researched industry quality standards regarding food production, processing and storing and I developed methods to meet or exceed best practice.

#### Commercial Mindset
I use my knowledge and experience and the findings and suggestions of my team to offer competitive business solutions and USPs in my feasibility assessments. I have a keen interest and a strong awareness of the international agri-business global commodities markets and a knowledge of current affairs and international relations.
